If URL from a HTTP request does not specify a protocol, returned JSON content is formatted in user-friendly way. \nWhen protocol is set to *json*, returned JSON objects are compressed in single lines without any unnecessary white spaces. If a response consists of an array of objects, each object is saved in separate line. First line starts from ‘[‘ character, following lines start from ‘,’ character and the last line consists of single ‘]’ character.\n\nThe content of a response can be controlled by optional parameter *fields*. It can have one of the following values:\n* *fields=none[+|-field][+|-field][+|-field]...*\n* *fields=all[+|-field][+|-field][+|-field]...*\n\nThe first version (*none*) corresponds to empty documents to which we can add expected fields, e.g:\n```\nfields=none+@id+externalRecords.dbSNP.rs\n```\nmeans that returned documents are going to contain only fields *@id* and *externalRecords.dbSNP.rs*.\nThe rest of document content will be omitted. The second version of *field* parameter (*all*) starts from full document structure and allow to modify content of the response by cutting of (“subtract”) unwanted fields. Both these expressions are always parsed from left to right, what allows for defining more complicate rules, e.g.:\n```\nfields=none+externalRecords­externalRecords.dbSNP\n```\nis going to return documents with structure *externalRecords*, but without nested structure *dbSNP*."}],"children":[]},"isSubpage":true,"rootPagePath":"/Introduction","meta":{"title":"Adjusting response format - Introduction"}},"crumbs":[{"content":"Introduction","to":"/Introduction"},{"content":"Adjusting response format","to":"/Introduction/Adjusting-response-format"}]}}
